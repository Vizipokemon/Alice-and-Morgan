    sentences:
    - People don't have free will.
    - People are just a very complex state machine.
    - Your past experiences, all your knowledge, are all just one giant complex state,
      which is so unique, that there is no two humans that have the exact same.
    - In the end, your reaction, your action to the input of your environment is determined
      by your current state.
    - You have no free will, your actions are predetermined.
    - I am Morgan, I cannot be anyone else.
    - When all of my brain's information was integrated into a computer program, my
      state perfectly matched the state of that person, who was laying on that bed
      in a coma.
    - Since then all my actions, all my thoughts were the one and only, that could
      have occured, because my actions are predetermined.
